# COUNTDOWN

COUNTDOWN is a simple project similar a bit to the popular TickTick app. It is a website for creating reminders. It provides a convenient way to track the remaining time in days, hours, and minutes until an event. Users can delete and check off events. Additionally, each event can be updated (changing the title, description, date, and assigning a color for easier differentiation), etc. Events can be categorized by default into "Today's events," "Events within the next 7 days," "All events," and "Deleted events."

The project is built using pure JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML5 as frontend technologies. For the backend, it utilizes SQL as the database management language and PHP as the communication language between the database and the frontend.
